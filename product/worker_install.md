# NuLink Worker Installation

NuLink can be run either from a docker container or via local installation. Running Nulink via a docker container simplifies the installation process and negates the environment requirements. Therefore, it is recommended that you use docker for installation.


## Docker install and update

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Pull the latest NuLink image.
```shell
docker pull nulink/nulink:latest
```

3. Select or create a directory on the host to map the directory in the container and store the data files generated by Nulink.
4. Copy the Worker's keystore file to the host directory selected in the previous step, ensure that the host directory selected in the previous step has permissions:
```shell
chmod 766 </path/to/host/machine/directory>
```
