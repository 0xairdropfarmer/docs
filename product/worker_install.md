# NuLink Worker Installation

NuLink can be run either from a docker container or via local installation. Running Nulink via a docker container simplifies the installation process and negates the need for a local installation. Therefore, it is recommended that you use docker for installation.


## Docker install and update

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Pull the latest NuLink image.
```shell
docker pull nulink/nulink:latest
```

3. Select or create a directory on the host to map the directory in the container and store the data files generated by Nulink.
4. Copy the operator's keystore file to the host directory selected in the previous step, ensure that the host directory selected in the previous step has permissions:
```shell
chmod 777 </path/to/host/machine/directory>
```

## Local Install

NuLink supports Python 3.7 and 3.8. If you donâ€™t already have it, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

In order to isolate global system dependencies from nulink-specific dependencies, we highly recommend using python-virtualenv to install nucypher inside a dedicated virtual environment.

For full documentation on [virtualenv see](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

```shell
pip install virtualenv
```

1. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment in a folder somewhere on your machine.This virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that will contain a python installation for a particular version of Python, and various installed packages needed to run the node.


```shell
virtualenv /root/nulink-venv

...
```

2. Activate the newly created virtual environment

```shell
source /root/nulink-venv/bin/activate

(nulink-venv) root@iZt4niz7s1ss0908w31u5pZ:~# 
```

3. Install/Update the Nulink package

```shell
(nulink-venv) root@iZt4niz7s1ss0908w31u5pZ:~# pip install -U nulink
```

4. Verify Installation

Before continuing, verify that your nulink installation and entry points are functional.

Activate your virtual environment, if not activated already:

```shell
source /root/nulink-venv/bin/activate

(nulink-venv) root@iZt4niz7s1ss0908w31u5pZ:~# 
```

Next, verify nulink is importable. No response is successful, silence is golden:

```shell
python -c "import nulink"
```

Then, run the nulink --help command:

```shell
Usage: nulink [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Top level command for all things nulink.

Options:
  --version       Echo the CLI version
  --config-path   Echo the configuration root directory path
