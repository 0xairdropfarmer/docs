## Roles in the NuLink Applicaiton layer

* **Alice:** Alice represents the data provider in the NuLink ecosystem. As the rightful owner of data, Alice can securely share her data with Data Consumers by leveraging the network's privacy-preserving data sharing capability. Alice has the ability to encrypt her private data locally and upload it to a storage provider using the NuLink Agent. Additionally, Alice has the authority to grant access to her private data by approving requests from Data Consumers. When granting access, Alice needs to send a transaction online to pay the service fee to the Proxies based on the fee rate. It's important to note that in the current version, the fee rate is set to 0, meaning no fee is charged for granting access. This fee payment mechanism ensures the proper functioning and incentivization of the Proxies within the NuLink network. 

* **Bob:** Bob represents the Data Consumers within the NuLink ecosystem. As a Data Consumer, Bob can request access to private data from Alice. Once his request is approved, Bob can securely obtain the encrypted data and decrypt it using his private keys. Bob benefits from the privacy-preserving features of the NuLink network, ensuring that data is securely shared between Alice and himself.

* **Storage Providers:** Storage Provider are essential entities within the NuLink network, offering a wide array of storage services and capabilities. Currently, the network's core storage network is based on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This integration enables both Alice and Bob to securely store and retrieve the encrypted data, leveraging the decentralized and distributed features provided by IPFS. As the NuLink network continues to evolve, there are plans to expand support for additional storage networks. This expansion will provide users with even more options to securely store their data, enhancing flexibility and accommodating diverse storage requirements.

* **Proxies:** Proxies play a vital role in the NuLink network by providing re-encryption services. To perform their duties, proxies need to register and stake NLK tokens for a specified duration. However, in the current version, as the NuLink mainnet has not yet been launched, internal proxies are utilized to offer re-encryption services. For developers, interacting with these proxies can be treated as a black box, allowing them to focus on their application development without needing to delve into the intricacies of proxy operations.

## How to develop Privacy-Preserving Dapp in the NuLink network

If you are new to the NuLink network and looking to develop a privacy-preserving Dapp, we recommend using the NuLink Agent directly. Integrating the NuLink Agent-SDK into your Dapp will automatically enable communication between your Dapp and the NuLink Agent. To learn more about developing with the NuLink Agent-SDK, please refer to the documentation [**here**](../dev/agent_sdk.md). Additionally, for information on how your Dapp can interact with the NuLink Agent, please visit the documentation [**here**](nulink_agent.md). To further assist you, we provide a demonstration Dapp that serves as a tutorial, which you can explore [**here**](agent_usecase.md).

If you already have a deeper understanding of the NuLink network, you can utilize the NuLink SDK to perform more fundamental operations in developing your Dapp. For a detailed guide on using the NuLink SDK, please refer to the documentation [**here**](../dev/agent_sdk.md). This comprehensive guide will provide you with the necessary information and resources to leverage the full capabilities of the NuLink SDK in your Dapp development journey.
