# NuLink Agent

## What is NuLink Agent?
NuLink Agent is a web-based digital wallet that differs from traditional plugin wallets in that it does not need to be installed on the browser. 
Instead, users can simply open a webpage and login to manage their NuLink private account data and digital assets, as well as interact with other DApps.

When browsing third-party DApps, if the application supports NuLink account authorization login, users can launch the NuLink Agent authorization login page for logging in. After logging in to the NuLink Agent account, users can perform a series of on-chain operations such as applying for fund account authorization, transferring funds, uploading files, and more. All of these operations will be recorded on the blockchain.
