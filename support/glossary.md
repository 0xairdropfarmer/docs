# NuLink Glossary

Welcome to the NuLink Glossary, where you can find key terms and their definitions related to NuLink's Web3-based ZK Provable Data Privacy Solutions.

## A

### Access Control

**Access Control** refers to the mechanisms, such as Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), implemented by NuLink to regulate and manage data access.

## B

### Bond

**Bond** is the process in NuLink where a staker establishes the mapping between their staking account and a service node, such as a worker node. After staking tokens in the dashboard, the staker initiates the bonding procedure to link their worker node to their staking activities. This linkage is essential for the network to recognize the staker's contributions and allocate rewards accordingly.

### Batch

A **Batch** in the NuLink network refers to a designated period, comprising multiple **epochs**. The specific length of a batch will be determined by the DAO in a late stage.

## C

### Claimable Deposit

**Claimable Deposit** represents the amount of deposit return to the staker after unstake. The staker can claim back in the staking dashboard.

### Claimable Reward

**Claimable Reward** refers to the reward earned by a staker within the NuLink network that can be claimed.

## D

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

The **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** in NuLink is a self-governing entity that plays a crucial role in determining various network parameters, including the length of epochs, batches, etc. DAO decisions shape the overall governance and evolution of the NuLink ecosystem.

## E

### Endpoint Encryption

**Endpoint Encryption** is a privacy-preserving mechanism provided by NuLink. It enables the secure encryption of sensitive data at the endpoint (i.e., on the local device such as PC and smartphone).

### Epoch

An **Epoch** is a defined time period within a NuLink network batch. Key processes such as reward distribution and staker changes are orchestrated on an epoch-based timeline. This structured approach ensures that these activities are carried out at the conclusion of each epoch, offering an organized and predictable framework for managing NuLink network operations.

## F

### FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** is a cryptographic technique employed by NuLink to enable computations on encrypted data without the need for decryption.

## L

### Living Ratio

**Living Ratio** is a metric within the NuLink network that represents the proportion of stakers who are actively participating.

## P

### PRE (Proxy Re-Encryption)

**Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE)** is an access control mechanism used in NuLink. It allows for the secure sharing of sensitive data.

## R

### Reputation Score

**Reputation Score** is a metric within the NuLink network that gauges a staker's historical contribution for a single batch. It assesses the quality of positive behavior epochs relative to the total quality of epochs in one batch. This score serves as an indicator of a staker's reliability and positive engagement with the NuLink network.

### Reputation Score Quota

**Reputation Score Quota** is a measurement that represents the proportion of an individual user's reputation score in relation to the total user's reputation score within the NuLink network. This metric provides insights into the relative contribution of a user's reputation to the overall reputation dynamics of the NuLink ecosystem.

## S

### Service Bonus

**Service Bonus** is intended to encourage stakers based on their performance. This bonus is generated from the service fees paid by users to the system. It reflects the active and valuable participation of stakers in delivering reliable and efficient services within the NuLink ecosystem.

### Stake

**Stake** is the process in NuLink where a staker deposits tokens into the pending pool. Tokens in the pending pool are scheduled to be counted in the staking pool starting from the next epoch. By staking, a staker commits tokens to participate in the NuLink network, securing it and becoming eligible for rewards based on the staked amount.

### Staker

A **Staker** is an entity within the NuLink network that actively participates in staking by providing services or computational resources. Stakers contribute to the network's operations and receive rewards in return.

### Staker Address

**Staker Address** is a unique identifier associated with a staker within the NuLink network. It serves as a reference for tracking and managing staking activities, rewards, and contributions.

### Staking Amount

**Staking Amount** represents the quantity of tokens a staker commits to the NuLink network as part of the staking process. This amount is a key factor in determining staking rewards and incentives for the staker.

### Staking Reward

**Staking Reward** is the reward earned by a staker within the NuLink network based on their staking activities and service performance.

## U

### Unbond

**Unbond** is the process in NuLink where a staker terminates the established mapping between their staking account and a service node, such as a worker node. By initiating the unbonding procedure, the staker discontinues the association between their staking activities and the worker node.

### Unstake

**Unstake** is the process in NuLink where a staker moves deposited tokens from the staking pool to the pending pool. Tokens in the pending pool can be claimed back by the staker in the next epoch.


## V

### Valid Staking Amount

**Valid Staking Amount** is a dynamically adjusted quantity of tokens committed by a staker to the NuLink network as part of the staking process. It is calculated by multiplying the staking amount by the living ratio. This adjustment ensures that the staker's contribution is proportionate to the overall engagement and participation of stakers within the network.

### Valid Staking Quota

**Valid Staking Quota** represents the portion or percentage of the total valid staking capacity that a staker is eligible or allowed to contribute within the NuLink network for a specific epoch. It is calculated by dividing the staker's valid staking amount by the total valid staking amount in that epoch. This metric provides insights into the relative contribution of an individual staker to the overall staking dynamics of the NuLink ecosystem.

## W

### Worker

A **Worker** is a participant in the NuLink network responsible for providing PRE services.

### Worker Address

**Worker Address** is the unique identifier associated with a worker node within the NuLink network.

## Z

### ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof)

**Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** is a cryptographic protocol used by NuLink to prove the authenticity of information without revealing the actual data.
